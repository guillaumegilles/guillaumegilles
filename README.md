### Hi there, I am Guillaume 

I am passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning! I strive to understand how machine learning algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems. I enjoy every part of a machine learning lifecycle: data preparation, modelization, and reporting to stakeholders.

Machine Learning is a boiling field, so every day is an opportunity to learn and discover new things. Hack the world, one day at a time!
